## About
This repository is intended to act as a staging environment and should automatically sync the `staging` branch of the main [repository](https://github.com/IEEEMerced/ieeemerced.com/tree/staging) with the `staging` branch of this [repository](https://github.com/IEEEMerced/staging.ieeemerced.com/tree/staging). Assuming the build passes, any commits made to the `staging` branch in the main repository will eventually go live on [staging.ieeemerced.com](https://staging.ieeemerced.com/).
